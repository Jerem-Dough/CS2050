## **CS 2050**

This was my first **notable** project-based Java coding course. In Computer Science 2 (CS2050), we learned about data structures, classes, standard formats, 
variables, primitives, library usage, and more.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various Java projects completed for CS2050, covering fundamental data structures and object-oriented programming concepts. 
Below is an overview of the implemented projects:

- **Album Management (Album.java, Main.java):**  
A simple Java program that models an album using an Album class. The Main class interacts with the user, prompting for album details and displaying the formatted output.  
  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST) (BST.java, BSTNode.java):**  
Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with operations for inserting words, in-order traversal, node counting, and calculating tree height.
The BSTNode class represents individual tree nodes.  
  
- **Array-Based Stack (ArrayStackClass.java):**  
A stack data structure implemented using an array, supporting push, pop, peek, and size operations.  
  
- **Linked List-Based Stack (MyLinkedStack.java):**  
A linked list implementation of a stack, featuring push, pop, and peek operations, with dynamic memory allocation.

- **Programs 1-8:**  
These programs explore fundamental concepts in Java, data structures, algorithms, library usage, stacks, trees, OOP, and more. With each program, we were tasked with demonstrating
our problem-solving abilities through coding exercises.  
  
Each project demonstrates the programming techniques we learned such as encapsulation, recursion, and data structure implementation.
