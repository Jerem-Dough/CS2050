## **CS 2050**

This was my first **notable** project-based Java coding course. In Computer Science 2 (CS2050), we learned about data structures, classes, standard formats, 
variables, primitives, library usage, and more.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various Java projects completed for CS2050, covering fundamental data structures and object-oriented programming concepts. 
Below is an overview of the implemented projects:

- Album Management (Album.java, Main.java):  
A simple Java program that models an album using an Album class. The Main class interacts with the user, prompting for album details and displaying the formatted output.  
  
- Binary Search Tree (BST) (BST.java, BSTNode.java):  
Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with operations for inserting words, in-order traversal, node counting, and calculating tree height.
The BSTNode class represents individual tree nodes.  
  
- Array-Based Stack (ArrayStackClass.java):  
A stack data structure implemented using an array, supporting push, pop, peek, and size operations.  
  
- Linked List-Based Stack (MyLinkedStack.java):  
A linked list implementation of a stack, featuring push, pop, and peek operations, with dynamic memory allocation.  
  
Each project demonstrates fundamental programming techniques such as encapsulation, recursion, and data structure implementation.
